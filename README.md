# Voice Game System

World of Warcraft addon that mimics the communication system from Tribes: Ascend.
The available commands are adapted or changed to better fit with Classic Hardcore WoW.
Keys are chosen to avoid moving the hand away from the movement keys or mouse. 

To use the VGS create a macro with one of the `/run` commands detailed below,
and bind the macro to a key of your choice.

## Chat

`/run vgs.Chat:exec()`

Battle category messages will play an emote as well when there is an applicable
emote with accompanying sound effect.

## Emote

`/run vgs.Emote:exec()`

## Chat and Emote

`/run vgs:exec()`
